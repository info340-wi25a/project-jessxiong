        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            With many students taking multiple classes, it can often be difficult for them to accurately track assignments, projects, tasks, and exams across all courses. Especially in students with ADHD, it can be even more overwhelming to go through each class and remember what they need to complete <a href="https://chadd.org/attention-article/tracking-homework-assignments-why-students-with-adhd-struggle/#:~:text=Pick%20a%20place%20with%20minimal,from%20the%20tasks%20at%20hand." target="_blank">(Heller, 2021)</a>. This is an issue, because missing a few assignments can oftentimes lead to a snowball effect of students falling even more behind <a href="https://creatingpositivefutures.com/why-its-hard-for-students-to-just-turn-in-missing-assignments-and-how-to-get-them-unstuck/" target="_blank">(Wray, 2024)</a>. Therefore, it is important to encourage healthy study habits in a convenient and simple way.

            An information technology problem regarding students keeping track of their schedules is the lack of features specifically designed to meet the unique needs of students. Current time management applications lack personalization and collaborative features, often being too general and not designed for students' needs which are academic success, time management, and engagement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many tools out there that try to help students stay on top of their work. The most notable of them being apps such as Google Calendar and Notion. Although Google Calendar can be great to help students plan out their events, it is difficult to track more than just a few assignments without the interface getting cluttered. Similarly, although Notion is a popular productivity and note-taking app, many of the features can be extremely complicated and difficult to learn and use. Users have found that despite being a productivity app, they often &quot;spend more time figuring out how to use the tools than actually being productive&quot; <a href="https://uxplanet.org/why-i-stopped-using-notion-an-honest-ux-review-ebf03e268a01" target="_blank">(Yip, 2023)</a>. Google Calendar and Notion are also very individualistic, where there are not many features that allow students to connect with others and build community.
